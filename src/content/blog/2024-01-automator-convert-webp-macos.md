On this blog, I often publish screen captures, pictures or AI generated images. Most of the time, I get files in JPEG or PNG format. Both are good, but not as optimized as I'd like for a thrifty static website. [WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) is better for that, can be loseless and is widely supported.

## Keep it lean

I could rely on Astro, which optimizes files during build. But this means I'd have to store large files with the source code and host them in my repositories. In such a situation, I prefer to solve "by design".

I used to convert to WebP with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) but it's a manual job and it can be a pain, especially with a lot of files to process. So I looked for an easier solution, on macOS (where I spend most of my Desktop time these days).

The file explorer (Finder) have a built-in tool for such tasks in its `Quick actions` menu. Unfortunately, output formats supported are only HEIF, JPEG and PNG. But macOS is extensible, so you can add your own quick actions through another built-in tool: [Automator](https://support.apple.com/guide/automator/welcome/mac).

## cwebp in a Shell script, 1-click away

As its name suggests, it allows you to create lots of automations within the system. Here, we are looking for a way to select files in the Finder and convert them to the WebP format after clicking on a menu entry.

The conversion part will be handled by [`cwebp`](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp?hl=en), you can install with [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install webp
```

Check the targeted binary (it should be `/opt/homebrew/bin/cwebp`):

```
which cwebp
```

Then, we need to create a `Quick action` in `Automator` and add (with a double click) `Execute a Shell script`. Select `image files` and `Finder` in the process input, `/bin/zsh` as Shell, `Arguments` as data input and paste this script:

```bash
for f in "$@"; do
  /opt/homebrew/bin/cwebp "$f" -o "${f%.*}.webp"
done
```

Change the `cwebp` path if needed. Save the action (âŒ˜+S), name it (`Convert to WebP` for example), it's now available! I tried this on 4 Dall-E generated images: I went from 12,9 MB to 909 kB, quite impressive.

## Automate all the things!

Now I need to explore how I can use Automator (and Shorcuts) more on my Apple systems. This is definitly one of my good resolutions for 2024.
