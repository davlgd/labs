It's been about 6 months since my last post on this blog. Why? I was focused. Mostly because of work stuff, but also due to personal changes, managing my fun/office balance, exploring AI and how it changes my relationship to technology, the way I produce things.

The main effect was that I lacked time to share what I was discovering on a regular basis, and that's bad. I devoted a significant part of my life to tech stuff in order to learn things and share them widely. I did so as a journalist for 20 years, and I still see this as a deep commitment.

I took the opportunity of a short break to think about how I could reorganize things and be able to spend more time sharing my discoveries again. No, this blog won't be written by an AI or any other kind of agent. But maybe I'll explain how to create such things, or with better ideas.

Wait n' see ;) Take Care.
