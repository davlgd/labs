Yesterday, there was a blog post published at this URL, entitled "Why I now use WordPress for this blog". Of course, it was an April fool's joke. I am not using WordPress for this blog, nor do I plan to.

I'm using [a static site generator](/posts/2023-12-how-this-blog-was-built/), and I'm happy with it. Of course, I edit my Markdown files with an IDE, but I'm fine with that, and I'm free to write my posts with `nano` if I like. But the most important thing to me is that this website fits into a few MB, it's fast and clear to read.

I can host it wherever I want, and I can move my Markdown content to another technology if I choose. Too many personal blogs involve big frameworks and many tools, for some requests per day/week/month. Not mine... KISS!
